          EmTechHack is designed to inspire students to use the latest
          development technologies - including blockchain, AI, machine learning,
          AR, VR, and computer vision - to build something new. However, you
          don't have to be a developer to participate. Our goal is to bring
          together designers, entrepreneurs, and developers so whether you're a
          veteran developer or a budding designer, EmTechHack has a place for
          you.
